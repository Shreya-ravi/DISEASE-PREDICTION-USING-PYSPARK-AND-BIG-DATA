DISEASE PREDICTION USING PYSPARK AND BIG DATA

Purpose and Goals of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to develop a disease prediction system that integrates machine learning algorithms with Big Data technologies. By using PySpark to analyze symptoms and patient profiles, the system aims to provide healthcare professionals with timely and accurate predictions, ultimately enhancing patient care.
The project specifically focuses on:
Data Integration: Combining various data sources to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
Machine Learning Implementation: Applying algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting to develop predictive models.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC to ensure reliability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boostingâ€”are employed to classify diseases based on patient symptoms. Each model has been selected for its robustness in healthcare applications:
Random Forest: High reliability due to ensemble learning.
Decision Tree: Useful for categorical health data.
Naive Bayes: Effective for probabilistic classifications.
Gradient Boosting: Excels in complex data scenarios due to iterative refinement.


Based on the input symptoms and the predictions from the models, the most common diagnosis is Common Cold, according to the Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting models, while the Naive Bayes model predicts Influenza
